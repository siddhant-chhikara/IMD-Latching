This repo containts designs for my custom PCB project which I designed for the formula student EV vehicle.

This PCB takes signal from a device ( Insulation Monitoring Device ) and controlls various things such as cockpit lights and Shutdown circuit ( safety system ).
This also includes various short circuit checks and fool proofed for almost all possible cases.
